                A Healthy Mind Lives in a Healthy Body:
            </h3>
            <P>
                Good and sound health would ensure an agile and active mind.

                Health, be it mental or physical is the prerequisite for living a good and fruitful life. Thus, neither
                the mind nor the body can be neglected. We must
                constantly strive to keep both body and mind healthy with proper food, rest and exercise. A good health
                helps a person to keep a positive attitude towards work and life in general.

            <h3>A Healthy Diet is Essential for Good Health and Nutrition.</h3>
            <P>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition.

                It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and
                cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and
                industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.

                A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods. Many studies about importance of healthy food
                relate to the importance of healthy eating to health as it can prevent the development of chronic
                diseases such as cardiovascular, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and so on.

                In other words, a balanced diet allows our body, on the one hand, to function normally and meet our
                basic physiological needs, and on the other, as we have already mentioned, reduce the chances of
                suffering from diseases in the short and long term.</P>

            <h3>Benefits of Physical Activity</h3>
            <p>Physical activity is essential to maintaining and improving health. The human body was designed to move,
                yet being active throughout the day is an increasing challenge in modern lifestyles. Exercise has
                immediate and long-term benefits to both physical and mental health for healthy individuals. RRegular
                exercise has also been shown to positively affect digestion and prevent the normal decline of metabolism
                that occurs as part of the aging process.egular physical activity reduces anxiety and blood pressure and
                improves sleep. Maintaining physical fitness benefits people at every stage of life.
