                A Healthy Mind Lives in a Healthy Body:
            </h3>
            <P>
                Good and sound health would ensure an agile and active mind.

                Health, be it mental or physical is the prerequisite for living a good and fruitful life. Thus, neither
                the mind nor the body can be neglected. We must
                constantly strive to keep both body and mind healthy with proper food, rest and exercise. A good health
                helps a person to keep a positive attitude towards work and life in general.
            </P>
